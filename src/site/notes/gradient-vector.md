### Gradient Vector
If $f$ is a [[multivariable-functions|function with two variable]] $x$ and $y$, the _gradient_ of $f$ is the vectorial function $\triangledown f$, and is defined as:
$$
\nabla f = \langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial y}{\partial y} \rangle
$$
its main use is in finding the [[directional-derivative|directional derivative]] of a function.

### Partial Derivatives in Higher Orders
One can derive [[partial-derivatives|partial derivatives]] several times, either with respect with one variable or the other.
$$
\begin{align}
	f&(x,y) \\
	f&_{xx} \\
	f&_{xy} \\
	f&_{yx} \\
	f&_{yy} \\
\end{align}
$$
This isn't limited to two times; it can repeat indefinitely.

##### Example
Prove that the mixed partial derivatives $f_{xyy}$, $f_{yxy}$, and $f_{yyx}$ are the same.
$$f(x,y,z)=\frac{2z}{x+y}$$
Since all our variables have exponents $1$, the result with be $0$.

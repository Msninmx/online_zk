### Set theory
Sets are collections of things that are similar.

Uppercase letters $A, B, C$ are used to denote the names of sets.
Lowercase letters $e, f, g$ are used for the elements. The order of elements in a set does not matter.
If $x$ is an element of $A$, it is represented with $\in$, if not, with $\notin$.
